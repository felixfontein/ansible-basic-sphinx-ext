Ansible Basic Sphinx Extension
==============================

This is a minimal Sphinx extension which adds some features from the Ansible doc site:

1. The ``ansible-output`` Pygments lexer;
2. Some minimal CSS so that the plugin documentation rendered by `antsibull-docs <https://pypi.org/project/antsibull/>`_ looks good.
